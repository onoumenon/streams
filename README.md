This project was done as an exercise for [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux).

To set up the entire project, you will also need a RTMP server, OBS (to start a livestream) as well as an API server for storing stream details.

Please visit [my blogpost](https://stuffihavelearnt.home.blog/2019/06/20/creating-a-simple-twitch-clone/) for set up instructions.
